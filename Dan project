"Get rich or live forever trying to get more rich" by Daniel Cheron

Pseudo code:

  $ Game area
- Draw a grid [OR] detect the boundaries of the window the user has opened

  $ Game objects
- An image gif of someone walking
- A picture of a coin or a gif of a coin/prize

  $ Game algorithms
- Player moves the gif using event listeners
- Gold coins are generated at random on the page
- Once the player resides in the same coordinates or square as the coin, it is added to a counter at the top.

-------------------------------------------
$ Game area

- Run a function when the user opens the HTML page. You will write the rest of the code inside this.
  Task => Make a generic html page that references the JS file you will use to write your code in

- Either generate a grid (look up how to generate a table using JS)
OR
- Use javascript to detect the width and height parameters of the tab/window and store these to a variable

- Provide some sort of variables for MIN and MAX game area values
- If the player is IN the last cell of a table, do not allow them to leave. (Can be expanded later to have multiple game zones)
- If the player is at the edge of the screen, do not let them proceed further


- know the width of the sprite
- cut the avail width into parts
- detect if the width of the sprite moving "x" number of times will not equal a whole number.

-------------------------------------------

$ Game Objects

- Assign variables that track the player's movements through the game area.
  - This can take the form of adding a value to an array, or assigning a new value to a variable whose value is the player's
  position on the screen

- Assign a variable that knows where on the screen the coins are

-------------------------------------------

$ Game algorithms
- Each time the player presses up down left right on the keyboard (or asdw), move the gif one "unit" in that direction.
  - Assign a series of event listeners to wait for user input and call a function.
    - Something like "when I click up, run function moveUP"
- Gold coins are generated at random on the page.
    - You can use a randomize function BUILT INTO JS and create an array (series of values) that distribute the coins
- Once the player resides in the same coordinates or square as the coin, it is added to a counter at the top.
  - Check to see if the location of the player (variable) is EQUAL to the location of a generated COIN
    - If so, add one/10 wtv points to the counter at the top of the screen.
